**Discofy** - A Discord bot created for the CSSS Mountain Madness Hackathon 2018

**Authors**:

* Jordan Yuen

**Purpose**: 

The inspiration for this bot is to interface with Spotify so that a user can allow other Discord users to queue up music in a playlist without having to use a Spotify collaborative playlist. Users can then use Spotify to "Listen Along" to the host. Users can also ask for the lyrics directly through the bot and get current track information and album artwork.

This bot relies on a user having Spotify premium and be listening along in the Spotify app.

**Install**: 








**Commands**:
**$artwork** : Displays currently playing song's album artwork.
**$clear** : Clears entire playlist.
**$forceskip** : Immediately skips current song.
**$help** : Lists commands.
**$list** : Alias for $queue command.
**$lyrics** : Display lyrics for current song from Genius.com.
**$pause** : Stop playback of current song.
**$play + (Search Terms)** : Searches Spotify for search terms, and adds first result to queue.
**$queue** : Displays queue of upcoming songs.
**$remove + #** : Removes the #th song. If no # given, removes most recently queued song.
**$shuffle** : Shuffles queue of songs.
**$unpause** : Resumes a song playlist.
